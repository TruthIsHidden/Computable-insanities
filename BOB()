BOB(n)

Input: A positive integer n.

Step 1 — Grid construction
- Construct a square grid of size n^(2n) × n^(2n).
- Total number of cells: n^(4n).
- Each cell may take one of the values {0, 1, n}.
- Constraint: In every row, at most floor(n/2) cells may have the value n.

Step 2 — Row factorials
For each row r:
  • Compute its row sum S_r (sum of all cell values in that row).
  • Compute the factorial of the row sum: S_r!.

Step 3 — Grid sum
Let the grid sum be:
    G = Σ S_r!     (summed over all n^(2n) rows).

Step 4 — Iteration
- Replace n by the value G.
- Repeat Steps 1–3 exactly n times.
- Let G_final be the grid sum obtained after the n-th iteration.

Step 5 — Meta-iteration (fg)
1. Compute X = (G_final)^n.
2. Compute m = sum of the prime factors of X
     (counting each prime factor with multiplicity).
3. Repeatedly subtract:
        m := m − (G_final)^2
   until m < 0.
4. Let fg be the number of subtractions performed.

Step 6 — Final output
BOB(n) is defined as:
        BOB(n) = (G_final)^(fg)!

Output: The integer BOB(n).
