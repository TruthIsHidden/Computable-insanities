Function F_mini(n):

Input: A positive integer n.

Step 1 — Base number
    - Let K = (n^4)^(2n)       # i.e., K = n^(8n)
    - Construct a K-digit decimal number S such that:
        • S has exactly K digits (leading zeros allowed)
        • Each digit is between 0–9
        • The average digit value is approximately 4–6
        • Digits are otherwise arbitrary/random

Step 2 — Allowed numbers and operations
    - Allowed numbers: D = {0,1,2,...,10}   # integers ≥0, ≤10
    - Allowed operations: Ops = { +, -, *, /, ^, log }
        (floor applied to log results if needed to get integers)

Step 3 — Representation count per digit
    For each digit di of S:
        1. Consider all finite sequences of operations using Ops
           and operands from D that produce an integer r(A SEQUENCE CANNOT HAVE MORE THAN, K^K operations)
           such that the decimal representation of r contains digit di.
        2. Let m_i = total number of such sequences for digit di.

Step 4 — Final value
    Multiply all m_i-to the power of n, produced for every digit, therefore if for number xyz, each digit produced a,b,c, the final value of F_mini((abc)^n)
