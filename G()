G(n)

Input: A positive integer n.

Step 1 — Base value
Let k = n^n^n^n.     (an exponent tower of height 4)

Step 2 — Initial number
Construct a K-digit decimal number S such that:
  • S has exactly K digits (leading zeros allowed),
  • the digit sum of S is exactly 5,
  • the digits and their order are otherwise arbitrary/random.

Step 3 — Allowed digit operations
For each digit d of S, one operation may be applied:
     (A) d → (10 − d)
     (B) d → (d − 1)
     (C) d → (d + 1)
     (D) d → (d + 2)
     (E) d → (d − 2)
All operations are performed modulo 10, so digits remain in {0,…,9}.

Step 4 — Global constraints on operation sequences
A sequence of digit operations is valid only if:
  • No operation type occurs more than 2 times consecutively.
  • In every contiguous block of 10 operations,
       each of the operation types A, B, and C
       appears at least twice.

Step 5 — Composite formation
Let C be the integer represented by S.
If C is prime, increase C to the next composite integer.
Let N = C^4.

Step 6 — Producing candidate integers
From any valid operation sequence applied to S:
  • Let S′ be the resulting K-digit number.
  • You may optionally remove exactly one digit from S′ to obtain v.
  • Append no additional digits.
The integer v is the candidate produced by that sequence.

Step 7 — Divisibility condition
A sequence is counted if its produced integer v satisfies:
       v divides C^K     (i.e., v | C^K).

Step 8 — Final output
G(n) = total number of valid operation sequences
       which produce at least one integer v
       (after the optional digit removal)
       that divides C^K.

Output: The integer G(n)!
