G(n)

Input: A positive integer n.

Step 1 — Base value
Let K = (n^4)^(2n)    # i.e. K = n^(8n)

Step 2 — Initial number
Construct a K-digit decimal number S such that:
  • S has exactly K digits (leading zeros allowed).
  • the average digit value of S is approximately 4–6.
  • the digits and their order are otherwise arbitrary/random.

Step 3 — Allowed digit operations
For each digit d of S, one operation may be applied:
     (A) d → (10 − d)
     (B) d → (d − 1)
     (C) d → (d + 1)
     (D) d → (d + 2)
     (E) d → (d − 2)
All operations are performed modulo 10, so digits remain in {0,…,9}.

Step 4 — Global constraints on operation sequences
A sequence of digit operations is valid only if:
  • For any digit position you may either apply exactly one operation (A–E) or do nothing.
  • If you do nothing at a digit position you may optionally append digits to the right of S in groups of 2. Each appended group is two decimal digits (00–99).
  • The total number of appended digit-groups across the entire sequence is bounded by K (i.e., ≤ K appended groups).  # ensures finiteness.

Step 5 — Composite formation
Let C be the integer represented by the original S (before any appends).
If C is prime, replace C by the next larger composite integer.
Let M = C^K * 30031.

Step 6 — Producing candidate integers
From any valid operation sequence applied to S (including any allowed appends):
  • Let S′ be the resulting decimal string (original K digits modified per-step, plus any appended digits, so S′ has length between K and K+2K = 3K).
  • You may optionally remove exactly one digit from S′ to obtain v (i.e., either keep S′ unchanged or remove one digit).
  • No further digits may be appended after this step.
The integer v is the candidate produced by that sequence.

Step 7 — Divisibility condition
A sequence is counted if its produced integer v satisfies:
       v divides M    (i.e., v | C^K * 30031).

Step 8 — Final output
G(n) = total number of valid operation sequences
       which produce at least one integer v
       (after the optional single-digit removal)
       that divides C^K * 30031.

Output: The integer G(n)!
