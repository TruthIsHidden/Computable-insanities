SYSTEM NAME: Maximal Oscillatory Object (MOO)

INPUT:
- n: Number of states of the object (integer ≥ 1)

INITIALIZATION:
- Create n states: S1, S2, ..., Sn
- Each state has a magnitude/value, initially 0
- Maximum magnitude per state: f = n

RULES / OPERATIONS:

1. Movement:
   - Start at state S1
   - From S1, you can only move right to S2
   - From Si (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1), you can move left (Si-1) or right (Si+1)
   - From Sn, you can only move left to Sn-1

2. Increment Operations:
   a) Add +1 to current state
   b) Add +2 to current state, subject to:
       - +2 can only occur once per 2 consecutive moves
       - Trigger effects:
           i) Decrease the highest-magnitude state by 1 (floor 0)
           ii) Increase the lowest-magnitude state by 1 (cap f)

3. Flip Operation:
   - Every 2 moves, apply flip to all states:
       For each state Si: Si_new = f - Si
       (Magnitude is reflected relative to the maximum)

4. Ordering Constraint:
   - No state Si can reach magnitude m unless state Sm-1 has magnitude m-1
   - Ensures sequential progression (cannot skip magnitude)

5. Periodic Injection:
   - Every k moves (k=160), optionally:
       - Add +1 to all states
       - Newly introduced states start at n (or defined value) but must reach max = n+1

GOAL:
- Maximize all states to magnitude f (or f+1 for newly added states)
- While following the oscillation, +2 restrictions, flips, and periodic injections

OUTPUT:
- Longest valid sequence of moves satisfying all rules
- Each move records:
    a) Current state chosen
    b) Operation applied (+1, +2)
    c) Trigger effects applied
    d) Flip applied if applicable
    e) Current magnitudes of all states

NOTES:
- System is finite and bounded
- Growth of maximal move sequences is extremely fast, comparable to or surpassing Busy Beaver numbers for small n
- States can oscillate repeatedly, producing long sequences before reaching the maximum magnitudes
